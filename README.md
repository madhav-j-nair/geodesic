### *I LOVE MY DIARY*

There are people like me who love to jot down their feelings in diary's or pages whether it be happiness, grief or a special moment in life. If you are also like that this is the perfect place. This is a simple webpage where everyone can type their feelings and they also have the choice to either keep it with them forget it or share it with others.
The layout is simple with a space for displaying the date(since Diary writers usually write the date before writing their thoughts/feelings) , a space for writing down their thoughts, three buttons, a green one to share the thoughts(share the textwith others) ,a red one to forget your thoughts(intantly clear the text box) amd an orange one to keep it(download the text locally to your system)

### *HOW IT WORKS*

1.The webpage consists of a place where date is displayed. For this moment library has been used (format:YYYY-MM-DD).

2.Below the date is a box (with a message "write your heartfelt entries" is displayed) where your thoughts can be entered 

3.The first button(green colored one with text "share my thoughts" displayed on it) on pressing opens a pop up with an option to share your thoughts. This has been implemented with the help of Web Share API.
(Note: Since Web Share API has been used this feature wouldn't work on some browsers but rather would produce a pop up "Oops! seems like your browser does not support this function")

4.The second button(red colored one with text "Forget it" displayed on it) on pressing which the text in the box gets cleared instanty.

5.The Last button(orange colored one with text "Keep it" displayed on it) on pressing which the text in the box gets downloaded as .txt file in the local system.

(Note: Unless there is a text inside the box the buttons wouldn't work)
